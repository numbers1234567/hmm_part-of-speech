# hmm_part-of-speech

Playing around with part-of-speech tagging using Hidden Markov Model.

Used SUBTLEX-US (http://crr.ugent.be/archives/740) for observation probabilities and Universal Dependencies treebanks (https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-5150) for state transition and initial state probabilities.
